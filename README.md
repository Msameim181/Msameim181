## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mohammad Mahdi, But I perfer Mahdi or Jack :wink:.

I'm a UX strategist, data scientist, and image processing specialist. I really love to solve problems and make big dreams more real.

As it should be, I'm a full-time learner and hungry to learn more, experience more. So feel free to contact me, let's have a chat with a cup of tea. 
As they said:
